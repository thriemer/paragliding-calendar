# Story 2.3: Daily Flyability Recommendations

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** paragliding pilot,
**I want** daily flyability assessments for the next 7 days,
**so that** I can plan my paragliding activities and travel accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1: CLI command accepts location and returns 7-day flyability forecast
2: Results show recommended sites ranked by flyability score for each day
3: Output includes weather summary, wind analysis, and site-specific reasoning
4: Multiple sites presented per day when conditions allow
5: Clear indicators when no sites are flyable due to weather conditions

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement CLI command for flyability forecasts (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add new subcommand to CLI (e.g., `travelai paragliding <location>`)
  - [ ] Accept location input (coordinates, city names, or regions)
  - [ ] Validate location input and provide helpful error messages
  - [ ] Support radius parameter for site search area
- [ ] Create daily flyability analysis engine (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Combine site data from Story 2.1 with weather forecasts
  - [ ] Apply wind analysis from Story 2.2 for each site/day combination
  - [ ] Rank sites by flyability score for each day
  - [ ] Handle cases where no sites meet flyability criteria
- [ ] Implement comprehensive output formatting (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Design human-readable output format for daily recommendations
  - [ ] Include weather summary (temperature, wind, precipitation, clouds)
  - [ ] Show wind analysis details (direction, speed, compatibility)
  - [ ] Provide site-specific reasoning for scores
- [ ] Add multi-site daily recommendations (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Display multiple flyable sites per day when available
  - [ ] Sort sites by flyability score within each day
  - [ ] Include distance information from search center
  - [ ] Show alternative sites for different wind conditions
- [ ] Implement non-flyable condition handling (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Detect days with no flyable sites
  - [ ] Provide clear messaging for poor weather days
  - [ ] Suggest alternative activities or timing recommendations
  - [ ] Explain why conditions are not suitable for flying

## Tasks / Subtasks (continued)

- [ ] Add forecast confidence and uncertainty indicators
  - [ ] Show forecast reliability for each day (confidence decreases over time)
  - [ ] Indicate uncertainty ranges for marginal conditions
  - [ ] Provide warnings for rapidly changing conditions
- [ ] Implement output format options
  - [ ] Default human-readable console output
  - [ ] Optional JSON output for programmatic use
  - [ ] Structured data suitable for further processing

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Integrates site data from Story 2.1 (both Paragliding Earth API and DHV XML)
- Uses wind analysis engine from Story 2.2 for flyability calculations
- Extends weather API integration from Epic 1 Story 1.3
- Follows CLI patterns and error handling from Epic 1

### CLI Command Design
```bash
travelai paragliding "Chamonix, France" --radius 50km --days 7
travelai paragliding 45.9237,6.8694 --radius 30km --format json
```

### Output Format Example
```
TravelAI Paragliding Forecast - Chamonix Area (50km radius)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Day 1 - Saturday, November 30th
Weather: Sunny, 12°C, Wind WSW 15-20 km/h, 0% rain

🟢 Excellent Conditions (Score: 8.5/10)
  1. Planpraz (8.5/10) - 5km N
     Wind: WSW 18 km/h, perfect for west launch
     Reason: Favorable wind direction, moderate speed, clear skies
  
  2. Brévent (7.2/10) - 8km NE  
     Wind: WSW 16 km/h, good for multiple launches
     Reason: Good wind alignment, slight thermal potential

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Day 2 - Sunday, December 1st
Weather: Partly cloudy, 8°C, Wind N 25-35 km/h, 20% rain

🟡 Marginal Conditions (Score: 4.2/10)
  1. South-facing sites only (4.2/10)
     Wind: Strong north winds, limited site options
     Caution: High wind speeds, experienced pilots only

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Day 3 - Monday, December 2nd
Weather: Rain, 6°C, Wind variable 10-15 km/h, 80% rain

🔴 Not Flyable
  Reason: Persistent precipitation, poor visibility
  Alternative: Indoor planning, equipment maintenance
```

### Data Integration Strategy
- Fetch 7-day weather forecast for search area
- Load sites within specified radius from search center
- Apply wind analysis to each site for each forecast day
- Rank and filter results by flyability scores

### Scoring and Ranking Logic
- Use scoring system from Story 2.2 (0-10 scale)
- Consider multiple factors: wind compatibility, weather conditions, safety margins
- Filter out sites below minimum flyability threshold (e.g., score < 3)
- Provide reasoning text for each recommendation

### Error Handling
- Handle API failures gracefully with cached data when available
- Provide meaningful errors for invalid locations
- Handle cases with no sites in search area
- Manage weather data unavailability

### Testing
**Test file location:** tests/integration/
**Testing frameworks:** Use tokio-test for async CLI testing, mockito for API mocking
**Test standards:**
- Integration tests with mocked weather and site data
- CLI argument parsing and validation tests
- Output format verification tests
- Edge case testing (no flyable sites, API failures)
- Multi-day forecast accuracy tests
- Different location input format tests
